"**Ti**ny **No**de": battery powered wireless sensor or wireless actor.
This is the 2nd generation of TiNo. There are numerous technical improvements, mainly more flash memory and further reduction of power consumption. The antenna is now accommodated on the PCB. The project is based on Microchip Avr0 series processors (here the Atmega3208 or atmega4808).

The key points are still the same:

- simplicity
- low cost
- very small size (smaller than a matchbox)
- ultra low sleep current
- long battery life time: 5 years and more on a CR2032 cell
- long range (100m +)
- (even) simple(r) to build up
- communication security
- Plug&Play Firmware

Sensors can be almost any, like temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, altitude meter, light intensity, UV Index, movement detectors (PIR), Reed switches, etc. However sensors have to be specified to work down to 2.2V. Otherwise the charge of the battery can not be fully used.

PCBs fit into low cost PVC boxes with the size of a matchbox that are readily available on the market.

# How To Install with Arduino IDE
1. Install MegaCoreX
2. Install TiNo2 libraries

## Installation of  MegaCoreX via Boards Manager
* Open Arduino IDE.
* Open the **File > Preferences** menu item.
* Enter the following URL in **Additional Boards Manager URLs**:
    ```
    https://mcudude.github.io/MegaCoreX/package_MCUdude_MegaCoreX_index.json
    ```
* Separate the URLs using a comma ( **,** ) if you have more than one URL
* Open the **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...** menu item.
* Wait for the platform indexes to finish downloading.
* Scroll down until you see the **MegaCoreX** entry and click on it.
* Click **Install**.
* After installation is complete close the **Boards Manager** window.

## MegacoreX Manual Installation
Click on the "Download ZIP" button. Extract the ZIP file, and move the extracted folder to the location "**~/Documents/Arduino/hardware**". Create the "hardware" folder if it doesn't exist.
Open Arduino IDE and a new category in the boards menu called "MegaCoreX" will show up.

## Install TiNo2 package
* Open Arduino IDE.
* Open the **File > Preferences** menu item.
* Enter the following URL in **Additional Boards Manager URLs**:
    ```
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nurazur/TiNo2/master/package_nurazur_TiNo2_index.json
    ```
* Separate the URLs using a comma ( **,** ) if you have more than one URL
* Open the **Tools > Board > Boards Manager...** menu item.
* Wait for the platform indexes to finish downloading.
* Scroll down until you see the **nurazur TiNo2 Boards** entry and click on it.
* Click **Install**.
